    			<p>They say a house doesn’t make a home. Well, that’s wholeheartedly true, because YOU do.  Your home is an extension of yourself, and your furniture should support that! </p>
    			<p>That’s why a sideboard isn’t just soulless storage. It’s a collector of memories. Where you keep precious souvenirs from your travels, and photos of your family. A kitchen shelf isn’t necessarily just for keeping utensils, but also a window into your culture and identity, keeping all the spices, cookbooks and decorations that make up your taste.</p>
    			<p>Check out our selection in your nearby store or buy your furniture online from the comfort of your home. </p>

    		<h2>Style</h2>
    		<div class="article-body">
    			<p>We have made it our purpose to have a wide range of affordable furniture available in different styles that complement your home including modern, traditional, farmhouse, bohemian, and nautical. All to make sure you, and your personality, can truly shine through in all aspects of your home. </p>
    			<p>There are so many styles that you can combine and create the aesthetic look you want. How do you know what style works for you? It all goes back to how you want your home to reflect who YOU are! Are you in the city and want a more modern sleek minimalist look maybe in black and white? Or maybe you live more on the shore and prefer a coastal nautical look that could include wicker furniture with navy blue and yellow color tones. </p>

    		<h2>Materials</h2>
    		<div class="article-body">
    			<p>Today, 60% of our products use renewable materials. Our goal is that all our materials will be renewable or recycled by 2030. Over the years, we’ve made it easier than ever to find affordable home furnishings that are better for the environment. Learn more about prolonging the life of your furniture here.  </p>
    			<h3>Wood</h3>
    			<p>Wood is the material most associated with our furniture, and for good reasons. We love working with wood not only because it’s part of our Scandinavian design heritage – wood is an excellent material from a design, quality and environmental perspective, if it comes from responsibly managed forests. Wood is also durable, renewable, recyclable – and beautiful. Since 2017, 100% of the wood we source from countries with a history of challenges related to forest management, comes from more sustainable sources. </p>
    			<h3>Leather</h3>
    			<p>Our coated fabric is durable, lower priced, yet with the same look and feel. And they’re both tested and approved for tear strength, flexibility and color fastness, so you can enjoy these sofas for many years. They’re also very easy to clean and maintain to keep it lasting in mint condition.</p>
    			<h3>Cotton</h3>
    			<p>Cotton is found in many of our products such as sofas, cushions, pillows, mattresses, and bed sheets. We made a promise to only work with those that grow cotton in a responsible way, not with any organizations that harm the environment or the people that work there. Our cotton is sustainable, so it’s either recycled or grown with smaller amounts of water or chemicals and fertilizers.  </p>
